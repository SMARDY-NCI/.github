SMARDY aims to develop a research data marketplace for technology transfer built as a software and data carpentry (i.e., developing and teaching workshops on the main data skills required to conduct research), where academia, industry, and government can exchange curated datasets, technology, and tools to foster economic and social development.

This is the organisational account for the National College of Ireland team working on the SMARDY project, which includes [Alba González-Cebrián](https://github.com/albagc) and [Luke McGuinness](https://github.com/mcguinlu).
